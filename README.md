# rock-paper-scissors

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript with an equally simple GUI using some HTML.

## Skills
This was a short project testing my logic and programming skills in JavaScript. I created functions and a simple game loop versus a randomised computer player. I practised some DOM manipulation techniques and worked with events and custom functions.

## Conclusion
A few more changes could be made including some visual polishing, as well as simplifying the code and functions with while loops, and improving the randomiser formula for the CPU opponent.
