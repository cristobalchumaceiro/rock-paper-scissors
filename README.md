# rock-paper-scissors

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript that runs in your browsers console.

## Skills
This was a short project testing my logic and programming skills in JavaScript. I created functions and a simple game loop versus a randomised computer player.

## Conclusion
Lots to work on after such as input validation, and a GUI so that it doesn't just run in the background console.
